= Common zkVM Guest

This crate provides a common zkVM agnostic logic, to be used both by Risc0 and SP1 guests:

[source,rust]
----
fn guest_handler(input_buffer: &[u8]);
----

The only role of the final ZKVM guest wrapper is to provide input data.

CAUTION: The only reason why Risc0 and SP1 guest wrappers are a separate and out of workspace crates, is that we need to use different set of patches (precompiles).

== Tracking Cycles

In Risc0 tracking cycles can be done with a dedicated syscall:

[source,rust]
----
let start: u64 = risc0_zkvm::guest::env::cycle_count();
// do some stuff here...
let end: u64 = risc0_zkvm::guest::env::cycle_count();
eprintln!("Cycles: {}", end - start);
----

In SP1 we use cycle tracker mechanism - invoked via stdout print:

[source,rust]
----
println!("cycle-tracker-start: some_stuff");
// do some stuff here...
println!("cycle-tracker-end: some_stuff");
----

However, measuring cycles is not strictly linear to the proving time. For that reason I am avoiding it and rely on time measurements instead.
